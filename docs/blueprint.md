# **App Name**: AutoPilot Uploader

## Core Features:

- Hash Upload: Provide a drag-and-drop interface for uploading Autopilot device hashes, or copy/paste.
- Upload Progress: Provide real-time feedback and progress updates during the upload process.
- Data Validation: Implement basic validation of the uploaded hash data.
- Success Confirmation: A confirmation message upon successful upload with key details, for auditing purposes.
- Limitation Notices: Clearly state any limitations (e.g., file size, hash count) before the upload.
- AI Assisted Remediation: A tool that uses AI to offer suggested actions or solutions based on the validation result. For example, if the app detects duplicate hashes, then use the LLM to suggest a resolution procedure.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#87CEEB) for a clean and trustworthy feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F8FF), a slightly tinted white to make the sky blue pop.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for buttons and key UI elements to stand out against the lighter shades.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface, for a clean and professional look suitable for both headers and body text.
- Simple and clear icons for file uploading and status indicators. Icons should have sufficient color contrast against their backgrounds.
- Clean and intuitive layout with a focus on ease of use for uploading device hashes. Use of whitespace to guide user focus and make each upload stage clear.
- Subtle animations for upload progress and confirmations, enhancing user experience without being distracting.
